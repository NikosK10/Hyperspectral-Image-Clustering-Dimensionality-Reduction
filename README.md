# Machine-Learning

This project is related to unsupervised learning, specifically an application of clustering on hyperspectral images. Initially, we process and understand the given data, which consists of an image and the pixel labels. Then, we apply various clustering algorithms, such as K-means, Fuzzy C-means, PCA, etc. We compare the results of these methods and evaluate the clustering using certain metrics. Finally, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract feature vectors for satellite images. We utilize these for clustering and perform the same process using the pixel data of the images. The methods are then compared.

In the relevant files, you will also find the datasets used (image, labels)

The project was created as part of the course "Macine Learning" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my own research but as my approach to the problems given. We highlight that the project was implemented in Google Colab so parts of the code like the file management was done through this environment.
